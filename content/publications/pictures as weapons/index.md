##### Abstract

The present study investigated how posters used in Italian right-wing propaganda spread the belief that specific target groups deserved to be marginalized and excluded. Taking the theory of delegitimization [(Bar-Tal, 1989)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-3582-8_8) as the theoretical framework, we analyzed 179 visual images employed by Forza Nuova, a famous Italian far-right political party, during the period 2000-2018. Findings indicate that seven of the eight strategies of delegitimization were used. Furthermore, by using correspondence analysis, we found that every delegitimization process was strategically applied to each delegitimized target. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed also regarding the comparison with similar studies conducted in the past.
