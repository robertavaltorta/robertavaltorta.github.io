##### Abstract

This study was designed to analyze gender stereotypes and sexualization in Italian television advertisements. A sample of 287 Italian television advertisements broadcast from 9pm to 10pm was analyzed. Findings indicate that women in Italian television advertising were portrayed as younger and more engaged in care-related activities in the home environment than men were. Instead, men were portrayed as sportier, more independent, and more competent than women. Furthermore, women were depicted as more sensual and attractive than men. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed also regarding the comparison between this study and similar studies conducted in the past.
