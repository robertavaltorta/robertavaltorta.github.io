##### Abstract

The present studies aim to expand research on dehumanization in the work domain by exploring biologization - an unexplored form of dehumanization that involves the perception of others as infected and contagious - of physically tainted workers. By integrating the literature on biologization with that of disgust and physically dirty work, we expected that the biologization of workers would be explained by their dirty work environment and by increased feelings of disgust toward them. In Study 1, we showed that focusing on a dirty work environment (vs. on the person performing the work) increased feelings of disgust toward workers and, in turn, their biologization. Coherently, in Study 2, we found that a physically tainted occupation (vs. baseline condition) increased participants' feelings of disgust and biological dehumanization toward the worker. In contrast, a non-physically tainted occupation (vs. baseline condition) had no effects on disgust and biologization. The theoretical and practical implications are considered.
