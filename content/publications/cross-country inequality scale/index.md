##### Abstract

Understanding lay theories on the causes of economic inequality is the first step to comprehending why people tolerate, justify, or react against it. Accordingly, this paper aims to develop and validate with two cross-sectional studies the Attributions for Cross-Country Inequality Scale (ACIS), which assesses how people explain cross-country economic inequality. In Study 1, we tested the factorial structure of an initial pool of items in three countries with different levels of economic inequality, namely, Italy (*n* = 246), the UK (*n* = 248), and South Africa (*n* = 228). Three causal dimensions emerged from the Exploratory Factor Analysis: “rich countries” (blaming the systematic advantage of and exploitation by rich countries), “poor countries” (blaming the dispositional inadequacy and faults of poor countries), and “fate” (blaming destiny and luck). The retained items were administered in Study 2 to three new samples from Italy (*n* = 239), the UK (*n* = 249), and South Africa (*n* = 248). Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) corroborated the factorial structure of the ACIS, and Multi-Group CFA supported configural and metric invariances of the scale across countries. The scale correlates with relevant constructs (e.g., beliefs about cross-country inequality and ideological orientation) and attitudes toward policies related to international redistribution and migration. Overall, the scale is a valid instrument to assess causal attribution for cross-national inequality and is reliable across countries.
