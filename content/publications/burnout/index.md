##### Abstract

This study explores the psychological effects of the COVID-19 emergency on workers employed in the supermarket sector by analyzing their levels of burnout and the relationship between burnout syndrome and employees' workplace experiences. A sample of 422 Italian workers answered a survey addressing the burnout dimensions (i.e., exhaustion, cynicism, and professional inefficacy) along with perceived organizational factors and dehumanizing representations. Results showed that 32% of the respondents had symptoms of severe burnout, and 41% had symptoms of exhaustion and cynicism. More specifically, through cluster analysis, four burnout profiles were identified: "burnout" (high on all three dimensions), "engagement" (low on all three dimensions), "overextended" (high on exhaustion), and "disengaged" (moderate on exhaustion and cynicism). Each cluster showed a different pattern of correlates with the organizational and dehumanizing perceptions. Our findings contribute to the knowledge gaps of burnout and workplace experiences by providing insights into the ongoing health emergency among supermarket clerks.
