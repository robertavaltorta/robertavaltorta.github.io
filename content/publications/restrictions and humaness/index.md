##### Abstract

The present study analyses the effects of COVID-19 restrictions on self-perception of humanness through the increased sense of threat to fundamental human needs. Furthermore, in an explorative way, we analysed the possible impact of this pattern on the identification with all humanity, in terms of bond with humanity and concern for all humanity. Through a preregistered experimental study (*N* = 278), we showed that participants who were asked to recall COVID-19-related restrictions reported a greater sense of human needs threat and, in turn, higher levels of self-dehumanization. In addition, we found that remembering restrictions, compared to the control group, led to lower concern for humanity and indirectly affected it via increased threat of human needs and self-dehumanization.
