title: "Economic inequality and gender-based violence" 
author: [""]
summary: "Negative outcomes of greater income inequality extend beyond economic disparities, including lower well-being, shorter life expectancy, and higher mortality rates. This project intends to add a tile to this picture by investigating whether greater inequality is also linked to higher tolerance of gender-based violence among women."

#### Description

A well-established finding in the literature is that in more unequal societies, individuals with lower socioeconomic status experience worse health, higher rates of anxiety, and depression. Recent studies have demonstrated that **economic inequality** indirectly increases women's intentions to **wear revealing clothing** and that it does so by increasing women's **anxiety** about their place in the social hierarchy. These results are particularly alarming since much research has verified the link between **self-sexualization** (i.e., the tendency to publicly express behaviors typical of soft-core pornography, such as wearing sexy, revealing clothing) and **acceptance of sexual harassment**.

So far, I have demonstrated through several experimental studies that women who perceive greater **inequality** exhibit more **status anxiety**, **self-sexualization**, and **enjoyment of sexualization**, which are linked to a greater **acceptance of gender violence**, particularly in terms of minimizing violent male behaviors.

Understanding the processes behind tolerance of sexual harassment or assault and the profound consequences of economic differences on women's well-being is necessary to promote equality and shed light on the ecological conditions that perpetuate this controversial cultural trend.
