title: "Economic inequality and gender-based violence" 
author: [""]
summary: "Negative outcomes of greater income inequality extend beyond economic disparities, impacting various aspects of social and individual well-being. These include lower overall life satisfaction, reduced mental and physical health, shorter life expectancy, and higher mortality rates. This project intends to add a tile to this picture by investigating whether greater inequality is also linked to higher tolerance of gender-based violence among women."

#### Description

A well-established finding in the literature on economic inequality is that in more unequal societies, people of lower socioeconomic profile experience worse health and are more likely to suffer from certain diseases, anxiety, and depression. Recent studies have demonstrated that **economic inequality** indirectly increases women's intentions to **wear revealing clothing** and that it does so by increasing women's **anxiety** about their place in the social hierarchy. These results are particularly alarming since much research has verified the link between **self-sexualization** (i.e., the tendency to publicly express behaviors typical of soft-core pornography, such as wearing sexy, revealing clothing) and **acceptance of sexual harassment**.

So far, I have demonstrated through experimental studies that women who perceived greater **inequality** exhibited more **status anxiety**, **self-sexualization**, and **enjoyment of sexualization**, which were linked to greater **acceptance of gender violence**, particularly in terms of minimizing violent male behaviors. Understanding the processes behind tolerance of sexual harassment or assault and the profound consequences of economic differences on women's well-being is necessary to promote equality and shed light on the ecological conditions that perpetuate this controversial cultural trend.
