title: "Economic inequality and gender-based violence" 
author: [""]
summary: "Negative outcomes of greater income inequality extend beyond economic disparities, including lower well-being, shorter life expectancy, and higher mortality rates. This project intends to add a tile to this picture by investigating whether greater inequality is also linked to higher tolerance of gender-based violence among women."

#### Description

A well-established finding in the literature is that in more unequal societies, individuals with lower socioeconomic status experience worse health, higher rates of anxiety, and depression. Recent studies have demonstrated that **economic inequality** indirectly increases women's intentions to **wear revealing clothing** and that it does so by increasing women's **anxiety** about their place in the social hierarchy. These results are particularly alarming since much research has verified the link between **self-sexualization** (i.e., the tendency to publicly express behaviors typical of soft-core pornography, such as wearing sexy, revealing clothing) and **acceptance of sexual harassment**.

Through correlational and experimental studies, I have shown that heterosexual women who perceive greater **inequality** exhibit more **status anxiety**, **self-sexualization**, and **enjoyment of sexualization**, which are linked to a greater **acceptance of gender-based violence**, particularly in terms of minimizing violent male behaviors. The effect of economic inequality and greater acceptance of violence has been replicated also using an **implicit measurement** to assess attitudes toward gender-based violence, suggesting that high inequality shapes psychological realities beyond explicit awareness.

These findings have important practical implications for interventions aimed at **reducing gender-based violence** and **promoting social equity**. Since economic inequality appears to be a key driver of status anxiety and self-sexualization, efforts to reduce inequality at a structural level may have significant downstream effects on individuals' psychological experiences and attitudes. In parallel, **educational programs** and **awareness campaigns** could help mitigate the psychological impact of inequality by fostering critical awareness and resilience. Additionally, the use of implicit measurement tools in these studies could inform the development of **more effective anti-violence campaigns** that reach individuals on both conscious and unconscious levels.
