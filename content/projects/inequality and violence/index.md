title: "Economic inequality and gender-based violence" 
author: [""]
summary: "Negative outcomes of greater income inequality extend beyond economic disparities, impacting various aspects of social and individual well-being. These include lower overall life satisfaction, reduced mental and physical health, shorter life expectancy, and higher mortality rates. This project intends to add a tile to this picture by investigating whether greater inequality is also linked to higher tolerance of gender-based violence among women."

#### Description

A well-established finding in the literature on economic inequality is that in more unequal societies, people of lower socioeconomic profile experience worse health and are more likely to suffer from certain diseases, anxiety, and depression. Recent studies have demonstrated that **economic inequality** indirectly increases women's intentions to **wear revealing clothing** and that it does so by increasing women's **anxiety** about their place in the social hierarchy.

These results are particularly alarming since much research has verified the link between **self-sexualization** (i.e., the tendency to publicly express behaviors typical of soft-core pornography, such as wearing sexy, revealing clothing) and **acceptance of sexual harassment**.

No sociopsychological study has directly investigated the relationship between **economic inequality** and **tolerance of gender-based violence**. The current project aims to examine this association through correlational and experimental studies.
