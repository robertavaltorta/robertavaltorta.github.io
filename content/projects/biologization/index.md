summary: "Biological dehumanization (or biologization) is a form of dehumanization in which others are perceived as viruses and contagious entities rather than human beings. The present line of research explores this phenomenon by investigating its antecedents and consequences through correlational and experimental studies."

#### Description

Much theoretical work has revealed that metaphors defining enemies as **cancers** or **viruses** exacerbate perceptions of threat toward outgroup members and provide individuals with a justification for **aggressive behaviors**. This sociopsychological process is known as "**biologization**," a form of dehumanization in which others are perceived as more similar to contagious entities rather than human beings.

This line of research investigates biologization by examining its **antecedents** and **consequences**. So far, we have consistently demonstrated the key role of **disgust** as an antecedent of biologization. Furthermore, we have highlighted the effects of biological dehumanization by focusing on **indirect aggression**, namely behaviors planned to harm someone in a roundabout manner, such as excluding them from a group or society.

Currently, we are deepening our understanding of biologization by focusing on its manifestation toward the **homeless population**. Additionally, we are expanding the research to include the phenomenon of "**self-biologization**," which is the internalization of this process. In doing this, we are employing innovative methods such as **360-degree videos** and **virtual reality headsets**, allowing participants to engage with immersive scenarios that provide unique insights into these processes.
