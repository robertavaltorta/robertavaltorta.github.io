#### Description

Gender stereotypes often shape individuals' perceptions, expectations, and behaviors from an early age, influencing both personal identities and social interactions. While some progress has been made in challenging these traditional views, gender stereotypes remain pervasive, perpetuated through media, advertising, and cultural norms.

We have examined **gender-stereotypical representations** in Italian **television commercials** targeting children and adults. So far, we have demonstrated that more **women** than men appear in **subservient and decorative roles**, and men have more important roles and a greater range of roles to fulfill. As for children, our results indicate that advertisements aimed at **girls** contain more **prosocial verbs** and are more likely to take place in the **domestic setting**.

Furthermore, we have investigated gender stereotypes within the world of **sports in Italy**, specifically aiming to develop a **scale** to measure the endorsement of gender-based beliefs within the **soccer culture**. This is particularly important in the Italian context, where soccer holds a prominent cultural role and traditional gender norms are often reinforced.
