### Research interests

I'm interested in everything related to the intersection of programming languages and security.

More specifically:

* Vulnerability Detection using Static Analysis
* Risk Assessment of Software Libraries
* Security Guarantees in Type Systems
* Language-based Security
* Research Quality in Computer Science (esp. artifacts)
