I obtained my PhD in Social Psychology from the [University of Milano-Bicocca](https://en.unimib.it/) in 2019, with a project focused on **dehumanization and its correlates**. This area continues to be a key interest in my work, alongside other topics such as **gender stereotypes**, **socioeconomic inequality**, and **food sustain**

From 2020 to 2024, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Milano-Bicocca, while also teaching social and group psychology at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en). Prior to this, I contributed to various projects, including a line of research on **dehumanization in political propaganda** at [Panteion University](https://www.panteion.gr/en/) in Athens, and an investigation into the relationship between **digital technologies and well-being** at the [University of Valle d'Aosta](https://www.univda.it/international/en/).
