I obtained my PhD in Social Psychology from the [University of Milano-Bicocca](https://en.unimib.it/) in 2019, with a project on **dehumanization**, which received the "Best Doctoral Dissertation in Social Psychology" award from the Italian Association of Psychology. This area remains a key interest in my work, alongside other topics such as **gender stereotypes**, **socioeconomic inequality**, and **food sustainability**.

From 2020 to 2024, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Milano-Bicocca, while also teaching social and group psychology at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en). During this period, my research mainly focused on **workplace dehumanization**, earning recognition in 2023 with the "Young Talent" award from the University of Milano-Bicocca and the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei.

Prior to this, I contributed to various projects, including a study on the role of **dehumanization in political propaganda** during a research visit at [Panteion University](https://www.panteion.gr/en/) in Athens, and an investigation into the relationship between **digital technologies and well-being** at the [University of Valle d'Aosta](https://www.univda.it/international/en/). More recently, I was a fixed-term researcher and assistant 
professor at [Pegaso University](https://www.unipegaso.it/), gaining experience in digital teaching strategies.
