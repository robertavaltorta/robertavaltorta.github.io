I obtained my PhD in Social Psychology from the University of Milano-Bicocca in 2019, with a project on **dehumanization**. This area continues to be a key interest in my work, alongside other topics such as **gender stereotypes**, **socioeconomic inequality**, and **food sustainability**.

From 2020 to 2024, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Milano-Bicocca and taught social and group psychology at the University of Trento. Prior to this, I contributed to projects on **dehumanization in political propaganda** at Panteion University in Athens and on **digital technologies and well-being** at the University of Valle d'Aosta.
