### Biography

I obtained my PhD in Social Psychology from the [University of Milano-Bicocca](https://en.unimib.it/) in 2019, with a project on **dehumanization**. My PhD thesis was awarded the "Best Doctoral Dissertation in Social Psychology" award by the [Italian Association of Psychology](https://aipass.org/). This area remains a key interest in my work, alongside other topics such as **gender stereotypes**, **socioeconomic inequality**, and **food sustainability**.

Over the years, I have contributed to various research projects, including a study on the role of **dehumanization in political propaganda** during a research visit at [Panteion University](https://www.panteion.gr/en/) in Athens, and an investigation into the relationship between **digital technologies and well-being** at the [University of Valle d'Aosta](https://www.univda.it/international/en/).

Between 2020 and 2024, I held a postdoctoral research position at the University of Milano-Bicocca, during which I also taught courses of social and group psychology at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en). My work during this period focused on topics such as **job burnout and workplace dehumanization**, earning recognition in 2023 with the "Young Talent" award from the University of Milano-Bicocca and the [Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei](https://www.lincei.it/en).

I am involved in several research projects, including international collaborations, and have presented my findings at conferences across Europe. I also contribute to the peer-review process as an ad hoc reviewer for academic journals in social psychology.
