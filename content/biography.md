I obtained my PhD in Social Psychology from the University of Milano-Bicocca in 2019, with a project on **dehumanization**. During this period, I also spent time as a visiting researcher at Panteion University in Athens, where I contributed to projects on **dehumanization in political propaganda**.

From 2019 to 2024, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Valle d'Aosta and the University of Milano-Bicocca, while also teaching social and group psychology at the University of Trento. In these years, I continued to focus on dehumanization, along with other topics such as **gender stereotypes**, **socioeconomic inequality**, and **food sustainability**.
