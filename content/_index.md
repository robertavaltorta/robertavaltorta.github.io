I am a **postdoctoral researcher** and **adjunct professor of social psychology** at the University of Milano-Bicocca, where I earned my PhD in 2019 with a project on **dehumanization**. During that period, I also spent time as a visiting researcher at Panteion University in Athens, working on **dehumanization in political propaganda**.

From 2019, I was a postdoc at the University of Valle d'Aosta and the University of Milano-Bicocca, while also teaching social and group psychology at the University of Trento. In these years, I have been focusing on dehumanization, along with other topics such as **gender stereotypes**, **socioeconomic inequality**, and **food sustainability**.
