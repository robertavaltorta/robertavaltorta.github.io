  I am a <strong>postdoctoral researcher</strong> and <strong>adjunct professor of social psychology</strong> at the University of Milano-Bicocca, where I earned my PhD in 2019 with a project on <strong>dehumanization</strong>. During that period, I also spent time as a visiting researcher at Panteion University in Athens, working on <strong>dehumanization in political propaganda</strong>.
  <br><br> 
  From 2019, I was a postdoc at the University of Valle d'Aosta and the University of Milano-Bicocca, while also teaching social and group psychology at the University of Trento. In these years, I have been focusing on dehumanization, along with other topics such as <strong>gender stereotypes</strong>, <strong>socioeconomic inequality</strong>, and <strong>food sustainability</strong>.
