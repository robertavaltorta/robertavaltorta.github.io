### Short Biography

Since 2020 I am a (tenure-track) professor at [Technische Universität Dortmund](https://sse.cs.tu-dortmund.de/). 

I was (interim) Professor for IT security at Paderborn University from October 2019 to September 2020.

I received my doctoral degree from [Technische Universität Darmstadt](http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/) in 2016 while working in [Mira Mezini's](https://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/main_stg/staff_stg/mira_mezini_1.en.jsp) [Software Technology Group](https://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/) on problems in the field of static analysis and security.
