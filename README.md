# Minimalist Hugo Template for Academic Websites

This repository is a fork of the [Minimalist Hugo Template for Academic Websites](https://github.com/pmichaillat/hugo-website) created by [Pascal Michaillat](https://github.com/pmichaillat). I have customized the template to fit my specific needs, primarily by updating the content and configurations with my own data.

## Customizations

This version of the template includes:
- Updated personal information and academic content.
- Minor adjustments to configuration files (e.g., `baseURL`, `author`).
- Aesthetic modifications tailored to my preferences, including changes in layout, typography, and color scheme.

## Documentation

For details on how to use this template, refer to the original documentation at [Pascal Michaillat's website](https://pascalmichaillat.org/d5/).
